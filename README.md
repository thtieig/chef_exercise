# lamp_centos7 Chef Cookbook

Chef cookbook to install a LAMP stack on a CentOS7 machine.

The current cookbook has 3 different roles:
1) **default** - basic packages and setup
2) **web** - Apache and PHP (including firewall rules)
3) **db** - MariaDB

To install all on a single server, you need to apply *web* and *db* roles to the same node.

Here some handy commands:

## Push a role to Chef Server
knife role from file roles/web.json
knife role from file roles/db.json

## Check what's available
knife role list

## View the role *web* pushed
knife role show web

## Assign a role to a specific node
knife node run_list set node1 "role[web]"
knife node run_list set node2 "role[db]"

## Verify
knife node show node1
knife node show node2

This is created **_just_** for learning purposes and is not intended for production environments.
Use it at your own risk :-)
